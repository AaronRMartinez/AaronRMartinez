# üëã Hello, I'm Aaron

I'm a passionate and driven aspiring cybersecurity professional with a strong commitment to continuous learning and staying up to date with the latest industry trends. I have built a solid foundation through self-directed studies, relevant courses, training, and practical projects. My interest in cybersecurity dates back to high school, where I regularly jailbroke electronics to unlock features. Whether purchasing cybersecurity-related books or participating in CTF exercises in my free time, my interest in the field has been longstanding.

## üéØ Objective

My long-standing interest in technology has fueled my passion for cybersecurity. This GitHub profile serves not only as a digital portfolio but also as a repository for personal projects and accomplishments. As I continue to pursue my passion and education in this field, I intend to expand this repository well into the future.

## üõ†Ô∏è Marquee Projects

**Active Directory and Group Policy Home Lab**

In this lab, I used Oracle VM VirtualBox to run virtual machines for both Windows Server and Windows 10 operating systems. A domain controller was established using the Windows Server ISO, and the domain was created afterward. The domain controller was then configured with NAT, routing, and DHCP. With the domain controller set up, numerous common AD procedures were exercised. Methods involving Group Policy, including software deployment, domain password and account lockout policies, password policy enforcement, and Windows Firewall configuration, were also applied. PowerShell scripts were also executed to accomplish administrative tasks such as creating user accounts or moving disabled user accounts to a designated organizational unit (OU).

**Microsoft Sentinel Home Lab**

Used a Powershell script to parse out Windows Event Log information for failed RDP attacks on a virtual machine hosted on Azure. I then used the parsed Event Log information and a third party API to collect the geographic information of the attack location. Finally, I created a Microsoft Sentinel (SIEM) workbook to display the physical location and magnitude of the attacks on a world map.

**Nessus Vulnerability Management Home Lab**

Installed VMware Workstation Player on a system that would be hosting several virtual machines configured with a downloaded Windows 10 ISO file. Nessus Essentials was also downloaded and installed on the host system. To ensure that Nessus could connect and run credentialed scans on the virtual machines, connectivity between the host system and the virtual machines was confirmed and Nessus was provided with the necessary credentials. Credential scans were run and in a trial, a deprecated version of Firefox was installed on a virtual machine to observe and note the inherent vulnerabilities present with the software. With a list of recommended remediations offered by Nessus, the remediations were conducted and the virtual machine was hardened.
